Session 1:

    Learned what endpoints are and that the HTTP request codes correspond to CRUD and @app.get. 
    Still have an issue with VSCode and the libraries. Will check this later on.
    I need to check what decorators are. Also, running the app with uvicorn.
    
    Video paused at 12:29

Session 2:

    Learned about HTTPException, Path, @app.post, @app.put, @app.delete and using 'status_code' 
    on the decorator. Also, using query parameters.
    Reviewed classes and inheritance with BaseModel, how to pass information from the URL to the endpoint.
    
    Video tutorial finished.

    Will do a tutorial on Python decorators.

Session 3:

    Finished decorator tutorial. Learned that decorators are a way to change
    the behaviour of functions without altering the original code.
    
    Also, learned to use *args, **kwargs on the wrapper function in order to make 
    the decorator useful in different cases with different functions.
    
    Learned about the 3-function Decorator Factory pattern for uses cases 
    where arguments need to be passed down to the wrapper function. 
    
    Still a bit iffy on understanding it deeply, but now I know there's a programming
    pattern when I would need to use a decorator function and pass down some arguments.

Session 1:

    Started with Async tutorial.
    Finished tutorial. I'm still confused, not proficient with Async functions.
    Prompted Gemini (LLM by Google) to create 10 exercises to understand them better along
    with requests, aiohttp and, of course, asyncio.
