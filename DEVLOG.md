    Session 1:

    Learned what endpoints are and that the HTTP request codes correspond to CRUD and @app.get. 
    Still have an issue with VSCode and the libraries. Will check this later on.
    I need to check what decorators are.
    
    Video paused at 12:29

    Session 2:

    Learned about HTTPException, Path, @app.post, @app.put, @app.delete and using 'status_code' 
    on the decorator. Also, using query parameters.
    Reviewed classes and inheritance with BaseModel, how to pass information from the URL to the endpoint.
    
    Video tutorial finished.

    Will do a tutorial on Python decorators.
